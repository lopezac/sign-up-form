# sign-up-form

This is a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) where I copy a design with flex, position, form, inputs and a litte of JavaScript, not worrying too much about responsive design though.
